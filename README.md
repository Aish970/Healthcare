# üìä Opportunity Score Generator

**Notebook:** `Opp_Score_Gen+MODEL-2.ipynb`  
**Author:** Aishwarya Bhethanabotla  
**Type:** Data Science / Scoring System

## üß† Project Overview

This notebook builds an **Opportunity Score Generator**, a model designed to evaluate and score opportunities (such as sales leads, job applicants, or investment cases) based on a combination of structured data attributes.

The goal is to provide a repeatable, interpretable, and data-driven method to rank and prioritize opportunities for downstream decision-making (e.g., targeting, resource allocation, outreach).

## üìÇ Notebook Structure

1. **Data Ingestion**
   - Reads input CSV or DataFrame with relevant fields (e.g., opportunity features)

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Missing value imputation
   - One-hot encoding for categorical variables
   - Normalization/Standardization of numeric features

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Creation of new composite metrics (e.g., conversion likelihood, engagement ratio)
   - Binarization or ranking of variables where relevant

4. **Scoring Model**
   - Model used: (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest, or Rules-based)
   - Computes an "Opportunity Score" on a scale (e.g., 0‚Äì100)

5. **Evaluation**
   - Visualizations (e.g., histogram of scores)
   - Feature importance (if applicable)
   - Threshold analysis and calibration

6. **Output**
   - Saves scored data to a CSV
   - Optionally generates visual reports or dashboards

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas / NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- *(Optional)* XGBoost, LightGBM, SHAP, etc.

## üìå How to Run

1. Clone the repository or open the notebook in JupyterLab/Google Colab.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed (see `requirements.txt` if available).
3. Place your input dataset (CSV) in the specified path.
4. Run cells sequentially.
5. Retrieve the final output CSV with scores from the output directory.

## üöÄ Potential Applications

- Lead qualification in marketing and sales
- Resume ranking in HR systems
- Grant or proposal scoring
- Real estate investment ranking

---

## üß≠ Next Steps / TODO

- Deploy scoring pipeline as a Flask API
- Add SHAP-based interpretability module
- Integrate threshold tuning for optimized decision-making
